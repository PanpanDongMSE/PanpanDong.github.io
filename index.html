<h3>About me</h3>

         <p> Panpan received her B.S. from TianGong University (TGU) in 2012 (advisor: <a href="https://clxy.tjpu.edu.cn/2016/1213/c2030a23934/page.htm"> Prof. Qingsong Zhang</a>), her M.S. from Tsinghua University (THU) in 2015 (advisor: <a href="https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/zsx/main.htm"> Prof. Shixi Zhao</a>), 
                  and Ph.D. from Washington State University (WSU) in 2020 (advisor: <a href="https://mme.wsu.edu/min-kyu-song/"> Prof. Min-Kyu Song</a>). </p>         
         <p> Her research topic mainly focuses on the next-generation lithium batteries with high-energy density, including <b>(1) cathodes design</b>, <b>(2) electrolytes engineering</b>, 
                  <b>(3) lithium metal protection</b>, and <b>(4) solid-state electrolytes</b>. </p>
         
         <p> She was the TA for two courses: <b>(1) MSE201 (Materials Science)</b> and <b>(2) MSE302 (Electronic Materials)</b>. She also has some teaching experiences of <b>MSE201</b>. </p>
