<h3>About me</h3>

<p> I'm currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Washington State University.  
         I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Dec. 2020, under supervision of <a href="https://mme.wsu.edu/min-kyu-song/" > Prof. Min-Kyu Song  </a>. </p>
<p> My research topic mainly focuses on the next-generation lithium batteries with high-energy density, including lithium-metal batteries, advanced liquid electrolytes, and solid-state electrolytes. </p>
