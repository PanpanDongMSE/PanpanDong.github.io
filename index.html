<h3>About me</h3>

<p> Panpan is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in <a href="https://mme.wsu.edu/min-kyu-song/" > Prof. Min-Kyu Song's group </a>. 
         Dr. Dong received her B.S. from TianGong University in 2011, her M.S. from Tsinghua University (THU) in 2015, and Ph.D. from WSU in 2020.  </p>
         
<p> Her research topic mainly focuses on the next-generation lithium batteries with high-energy density, including (1) cathodes design, (2) electrolytes engineering, 
         (3) lithium metal protection, and (4) solid-state electrolytes. </p>
         
<p> She was the TA for two courses: MSE201 (Materials Science) and MSE302 (Electronic Materials). She also has some teaching experiences of MSE201. </p>
